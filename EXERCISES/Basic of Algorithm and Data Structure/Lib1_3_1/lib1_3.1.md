# <u>There are two descending order sequences of equal length. Design a function that find the median of union set of them.</u>

<font size = 4> The median of order sequences $A_0$, $A_1$, ···, $A_{N-1}$ is value of $A_{(N-1)/2}, namely the $\lfloor (N+1)/2 \rfloor$ number.\
<u>Requirements:</u>
1. Input: Input is divided into three lines. The first line gives the length of each sequence. then sequences are given in the rest lines. Numbers are seperate by blankspace.
2. Output: Output the median of two sequences in a new line.

Example:
```
5
1 3 5 7 9
2 3 4 5 6
```
